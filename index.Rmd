## Motivation

Unlike many factors we can control in determining our health, ambient (outdoor) air quality is almost impossible to alter given its ubiquitous nature. Across the globe, it accounts for significant morbidity and, to a lesser degree, mortality. Indoor air pollution is also an important exposure pathway particularly for women and children who live in households that burn solid fuel for cooking and heating. For this project, we focused on ambient air quality because there is more available data and because indoor air pollution is less widespread in the United States and New York State than in other places around the world. 

When someone breathes, they are exposed not to a single compound in isolation but rather to a mixture of compounds. Two compounds that are known to confer toxicity are ozone and fine particulate matter (PM2.5). Ozone is a fat soluble chemical than can bypass absorption in the upper respiratory system and penetrate down into the alveoli. PM2.5 is a tiny particle that, due to it's size, can also travel deep into the alveoli. Both PM2.5 and ozone can have harmful local effects in the respiratory system and, because of their ability to cross from the lung into the bloodstream, can have harmful distal effects throughout the cardiovascular system. 

We were interested in how air pollution in New York State, including specific compounds like PM2.5 and ozone, may lead to the acute exacerbation of chronic conditions like cardiovascular diseases and asthma as well as acute cardiovascular symptoms. Our goal is to illustrate potential health disparities across New York State, the trends in the relationship between air quality and acute health outcomes, and areas (geographically and scientifically) requiring future research.
