## Motivation

Unlike many factors we can control in determining our health, ambient (outdoor) air quality is almost impossible to alter. It accounts for significant morbidity and, indirectly, to mortality around the world. We were interested in how air pollution in New York State, measured through proxies such as PM2.5, ozone and air quality index (AQI), may lead to the acute exacerbation of chronic conditions like cardiovascular diseases and asthma as well as acute cardiovascular symptoms. Our goal is to illustrate trends in the relationship between air quality and acute health outcomes and areas (geographically and scientifically) requiring future research.

## Background

When someone breathes, they are exposed not to a single compound in isolation but rather to a mixture of compounds. Two compounds that are known to confer toxicity are ozone and fine particulate matter (PM2.5). Ozone is a fat soluble chemical than can bypass absorption in the upper respiratory system and penetrate down into the alveoli. PM2.5 is a tiny particle that, due to its size, can also travel deep into the alveoli. Both PM2.5 and ozone can have harmful local effects in the respiratory system and, because of their ability to cross from the lung into the bloodstream, can have harmful distal effects throughout the cardiovascular system.


## Related Work

Research conducted by Dr. Frederica Perera, Dr. Marianthi-Anna Kioumourtzoglou, and others at the Center for Children's Environmental Health, Columbia University, as well as previous classwork utilizing NOAA data inspired us to explore environmental data. Throughout our studies, we have learned that air pollution is known to have detrimental effects on human health. For instance, [high PM2.5](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5260007/) and [ozone exposure](https://www.atsjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1164/rccm.201811-2106ED) causes damage to the respiratory system, which puts individuals at risk for health outcomes like asthma and heart disease. We became personally interested about how air quality here may adversely affect our health outcomes upon learning that New York ranks tenth in [most polluted cities (by ozone)](https://www.lung.org/our-initiatives/healthy-air/sota/city-rankings/most-polluted-cities.html) in the United States.


## Data Sources

For our data analysis, we used data from 

* [New York State DOH HealthData](https://data.ny.gov/browse?category=Health&utf8=%E2%9C%93) 
* [NYCDOH Environment and Health Data Portal](http://a816-dohbesp.nyc.gov/IndicatorPublic/publictracking.aspx), 
* [United States Environmental Protection Agency AirData](https://www.epa.gov/outdoor-air-quality-data).

(Visit [Plots](plots.html) to look at plots of our findings)

Asthma: 

* Bronx County had the highest rate of asthma hospitalizations per 10,000 people out of all the New York state counties.

* It should be noted that the greatest PM2.5 level is in New York County, not Bronx County. 

* When looking at the association visually, a positive relationship between PM2.5 and Asthma ER hospitalizations is clear, although it is clear that ambient PM2.5 exposure is not the perfect predictor of asthma hospitalizations. Importantly, Bronx County is a clear outlier in the relationship. 

CVD: 

* The age-adjusted CVD hospitalization rates per 10,000 people across New York state counties are more consistent as compared to asthma. Bronx County has the highest hospitalization rates compared to other counties, although only slightly higher compared to the other counties. 

* The association plot shows a less clear relationship between ambient PM2.5 against CVD hospitalizations. 

* Visually, Essex and Chautauqua Counties have significantly lower rates of CVD than the other counties, which are clustered near the middle of the plot. 

Looking at our final models and their corresponding RMSE violin plots, we see that the adjusted model is better for both asthma and CVD hospitalizations. However, the asthma model is moderately well fitting with an R-squared value of 0.4044, whereas the CVD model is not well fitting with an R-squared value of 0.0488.  


## Discussion

### Limitations

<img src="images/nys_max_aqi.jpg.jpeg" style="width:95%">  

A major limitation of this analysis was missing data. Throughout the exploration phase, we found various measures of air quality for New York state that was incomplete. Although there are standards in place, definitions of air and air quality are not consistently measured across the different publicly available data sources that were looked at. Additionally, certain counties in New York state did not have any PM2.5 data available.

Missing data also caused limitations when looking at hospitalization rates for asthma and CVD across New York state. The final analysis shows a plot for CVD hospitalizations from 2012-2014, while the asthma hospitalization plot is only for 2014. This inconsistency makes it challenging to make comparisons across the two plots.

Finally, there could be other ways to measure the health outcome rates for CVD and asthma instead of hospitalization rates, which might not be accurate representation of true rates of the diseases based hospital access and other factors such as insurance status that might affect a personâ€™s choice to go to a hospital.

### Conclusion and Future Directions

The analysis confirms that ambient PM2.5 exposure is associated with asthma and CVD, using hospitalization rates as the proxy indicator. New York City counties, including the Bronx and New York, have high ambient PM2.5 exposure. Bronx counties has the most number of hospitalizations per 10,000 people for both asthma and CVD. Our analysis shows that exposure to ambient PM2.5 does not account for all the disparity in hospitalization rates seen in the Bronx, it does account for some of it. Interventions related to air quality should be focused in the Bronx and New York Counties. 

Future studies should look into measures of air quality that are consistently collected for better comparability purposes. Additionally, different indicators for asthma and CVD would be helpful since hospitalization rates might not be the best measure for the purposes of this research question. Finally, we would recommend looking for data beyond what is publicly available to get a more complete picture of what is occurring across New York state.
